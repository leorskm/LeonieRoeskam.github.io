										<p>This university project, completed during my final year, involved analysing a dataset generated from two surveys completed by students - one collecting basic personal information and the other assessing personality traits using the 16Personalities test. To compensate incomplete responses and inconsistencies, I used linear regression techniques in Excel to impute missing data and Python to detect outliers. The dataset included various metrics such as height, shoe size, distance to university, and personality traits such as extraversion versus introversion. 
											I also merged the survey tables using Excel's VLOOKUP, although the low completion rate resulted in a smaller dataset, so I focused on exploring and explaining anomalies within the data from the first survey.<br />

										<p>This Python project focuses on conducting basic statistical analysis and data visualization on a dataset detailing Netflix's library of shows and movies. Using a dataset containing Netflix data, containing information on identifiers, content type, title, director, production country, addition date, release year, rating, and duration, the project explores 
											content distribution, ratings, and trends over time through descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as linear regression. Key tasks include analyzing the prevalence of movies versus TV shows, examining rating distributions, and comparing content durations. Additionally, inferential statistics such as t-tests assess differences in release years 
											between movies and TV shows, providing insights into content refresh rates. A linear regression model predicts release years based on content type and duration, evaluated by Mean Squared Error and R^2 scores.

						<h4>AI for Ocean Conservation</h4>
						<h6><i>Thursday, February 23rd 2024</i></h6>
						<p>While contemplating the vastness of the oceans, I discovered how AI is being employed for ocean conservation. AI technologies analyze data from underwater sensors and satellite images to monitor marine biodiversity and track illegal fishing activities. 
							This not only helps protect endangered species but also ensures sustainable fishing practices. AI's role in preserving our oceans is becoming increasingly vital.

									<h4>Horse Riding</h4>
								</div>
							</article>
							<p>Horse riding has been my hobby since 2006. Over the years, I have engaged in various equestrian disciplines including dressage, show jumping, and my favourite, eventing. My journey began as a child and quickly grew into a profound passion for the animals and the sport. Despite a significant setback in 2007 when I fell from a horse and broke my thigh bone, I returned to horseback riding, unfazed. 
								During my childhood and teenage years, I dedicated most of my free time to this hobby, going on trips to barns for weeks in the summers. First I came as a guest and later continued going as an instructor. 
								With age, my understanding for the sport and horses grew and I discovered new techniques and approaches to handling horses. However, the pivotal moment in my riding career came after finishing school, when I moved to New Zealand for nine months. There, I had the invaluable opportunity to work alongside an Olympian eventer. This experience deeply enriched my skills and understanding of the sport. My role as a horse groomer and rider allowed me to immerse myself fully in the equestrian world, learning the intricacies of horse care, riding competitions and farm work. This period not only honed my abilities but also solidified my love for eventing, shaping me into the dedicated equestrian I am today.

									<h4>Our Start Up Project: due2grow</h4>
					
								</div>
							</article>
							<p>As part of a university module, we were tasked to come up with a unique start up idea and thus created due2grow. We embarked on our journey with a compelling vision: "Don't waste the seed!" Launched by a group of other students and me, the project aims to transform seed testing in the agricultural sector. Our flagship innovation, the Germinator, introduced a game-changing technology—non-destructive, rapid seed germination assessments powered by advanced machine learning.
								We target the production and sales segment of the seed industry, a choice that positions us in a growing market niche. We developed a unique value proposition with the Germinator, offering significant time savings and enhanced efficiency over traditional testing methods. This technology could analyse seed quality in hours instead of days, a critical advantage for producers looking to optimise crop yields and reduce waste.
								Marketing the Germinator was a strategic endeavour. Due2grow employed a multi-faceted approach, engaging potential customers through content marketing, direct demonstrations at agricultural fairs, and partnerships with universities. These initiatives do not only build brand awareness but also demonstrate the Germinator's capabilities directly to the industry professionals.
								The result is a brand synonymous with innovation and reliability, one that seamlessly integrates into existing agricultural practices, enhancing productivity and sustainability.
